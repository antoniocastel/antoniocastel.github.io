Welcome to my Website! 

I’m Antonio and I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Research and Operations Management at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem Business School](https://bschool-en.huji.ac.il/dr-antonio-castellanos). 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Principal Researcher at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business hosted by [Professor Amy Ward](https://voices.uchicago.edu/amyward/). I received my PhD from the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, advised by [Professor Galit Yom-Tov](https://gality.net.technion.ac.il/) and worked closely with [Professor Yair Goldberg](https://yairgo.net.technion.ac.il). During my time at the Technion I conducted research at the [SEElab](https://seelab.net.technion.ac.il) a worldwide hub for research and teaching in Service Engineering.
